# brgvos-void
BRGV-OS is based by Void Linux, is a custom Void Linux based distribution.  
  
  To build the iso image is necessary to use a Void Linux distribution where we run next commands:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/florintanasa/brgvos-void.git
  cd brgvos-void
  sudo ./build_brgvos.sh
  ```  
After that, if everythink works, we find the iso image is in directory `void-mklive`

The work is progress..
