# BRGV-OS

BRGV-OS is a custom [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) based distribution that aims to facilitate developers and users to transitioning from Windows to Linux by maintaining familiar operational habits and workflows.

## How to build

It is suggested to use Void Linux or other based by this distribution.  
To build the iso image is necessary to use a Void Linux distribution where we run next commands:  

>> In this moment the build is for romanian language only but with few modifications can be buildid for antohers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/florintanasa/brgvos-void.git
cd brgvos-void
sudo ./build_brgvos.sh
```  

After that, if everythink works, we find the iso image is in directory `void-mklive`

ISO file can be downloaded from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/brgv-os/files/brgv-os-2025/) 

Test ISO file result in virtual machine.
